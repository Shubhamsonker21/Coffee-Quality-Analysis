# Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the quality of coffee using various sensory attributes and defect occurrences. The dataset contains information about different coffee samples, including sensory attributes, defect occurrences, processing methods, origin regions, and total cup points, which represent the overall quality of the coffee.

# Objective
The main objective of this analysis is to identify key determinants of coffee quality, explore correlations between processing methods, origin regions, and coffee quality scores, and identify trends or patterns in defect occurrences and their impact on overall coffee quality.

# Tools and Technologies Used
* Data extracted from Microsoft Excel into Power BI for analysis
* Power BI for data visualization and analysis

# Analysis Steps
* Data preprocessing and cleaning
* Exploratory data analysis
* Visualization of sensory attributes and defect occurrences
* Correlation analysis
* Trend analysis of defect occurrences over time
* Identification of key determinants of coffee quality

# Key Insights
Identified key sensory attributes that influence coffee quality (aroma, flavor, acidity, aftertaste, balance, body).
Explored correlations between processing methods, origin regions, and coffee quality scores.
Analyzed trends and patterns in defect occurrences and their impact on overall coffee quality.
